# Payload-Game
Repository for submission/portfolio purposes as a demo/proof-of-concept; there isn't much "gameplay" or player intervention, although it's still a pretty neat battle simulation. Was originally made for Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2, but did not finish in time despite best efforts â€” I do, however, fully intend to finish and publish this game, although that will likely be in another repository, and the main repository here will likely be removed.

Some preview screenshots:
